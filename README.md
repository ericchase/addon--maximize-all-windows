# Unarchived
It's been a while since I've worked on extensions.
After seeing that this one is still used by a fair amount of people, I decided to unarchive the repo in case people want to post issues.
I'm not looking for feature requests. Just issues that might eventually come due to browser updates and such.



# Deprecated ~~New Version for Chrome~~
Chrome and Firefox now seem to remember window position and size between sessions.  
This extension is no longer necessary.

# Maximize All Windows

A Firefox addon for maximizing all open browser windows.

Get the addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/maximize-all-windows/

## Motive

I like maximizing all of my browser windows, almost all the time. When restarting Firefox, or on the first start, my windows never consistently stay maximized. I decided to make this addon to programmatically maximize them on startup and whenever the extension icon is clicked.
